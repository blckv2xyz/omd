# Open Media Distribution

This repo contains the specification for the Open Media Distribution (OMD) protocol. The protocol is designed to make catalog management within media domains such as music more efficient and reliable. It is born out of a need to reverse the process of distributing media in the digtial context and make catalog owners the central authorities of their own media and associated metadata.
